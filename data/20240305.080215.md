# Gaza war, Red Sea crisis and sea of issues for merchants

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Gaza-war-Red-Sea-crisis-and-sea-of-issues-for-merchants/172-278222)

Since the Houthis insist that they will not cease attacking ships in the Red Sea unless a ceasefire is enforced in Gaza, the Red Sea crisis will end only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And that appears to be a far cry.
