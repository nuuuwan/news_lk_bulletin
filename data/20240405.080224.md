In my opinion, the IMF program Sri Lanka has got now is lenient when you compare it with many other countries. The 17th IMF program may not be enough even if implemented fully. Therefore, there is very little space to make changes in the broader program targets.

1.Achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and beyond

2.Bring annual foreign currency debt service from 9.4% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP during 2027-2032. Reduce the government’s gross financial needs which was at 35% of GDP in 2022 down to below 13% from 2027-2032.
