# Red alert for Govt. to secure skilled workforce in construction industry

*2024-05-22 05:12:56*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Red-alert-for-Govt-to-secure-skilled-workforce-in-construction-industry/4-762100)

It is not surprising that the construction industry has shrunk in the last four years by 65-70%. Due to this, industry professionals, quantity surveyors, architects, engineers, etc. are leaving the country. We believe that, by now, a few thousand professionals have left the country. More than this, the biggest issue we are facing is losing the skilled workforce in the country. We can see a light at the end of the tunnel by potentially starting a few projects in the country by 2025. However, the biggest problem that we will face next is that we have no skilled workers to do the construction work.
