This would naturally place inflationary pressures on import-dependant countries like Sri Lanka, while driving interest rates up due to the institutionalisation of an inflation-targeting Central Bank. Most worrying is that a stronger dollar will impact Sri Lanka’s foreign debt burden, making raising revenue to repay debts much more challenging

It’s also important to recognise that abuse isn’t always physical. Emotional and financial abuse are often the most insidious forms, leaving scars that can’t be seen but take the longest to heal.

I’ve had queries coming my way regarding Fine Lines and Wrinkles.

Some would say with age it’s a natural happening but I believe if we take care of our skin, we can tone down Fine Lines and Wrinkles a great deal.
