The last two weeks suggest that the NPP is moving to the centre, most probably in a bid to grapple with the challenges of a slim majority. The new government has announced that it will oppose the upcoming UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka. This indicates that it is moving to embrace the nationalist space that was previously held by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family, but has since bifurcated, if not trifurcated. As Harendra Dassanayake and Rajni Gamage recently observed, the Sinhala Buddhist space in Sri Lanka currently lacks a leader.
