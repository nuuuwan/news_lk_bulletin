It’s been a long five years of waiting for the masterminds to be publicly named and brought to justice. Yet, incumbent governments choose to ignore the plight of the injured, and surving family members and their cries for accountability.

The governments of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe have studiously ignored the evidence placed before them. Instead, they’ve appointed those named and even fined by the courts for dereliction of duty to positions of command and power.
