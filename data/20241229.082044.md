Exceptional among them were Conrad Hunte, who spoke eloquently of his MRA (Moral Rearmament) connections and the dashing Rohan Kanhai.

I was perhaps a little overenthusiastic, in trying to claim objectivity for Rajiva Wijesinha’s latest book, when I said at the launch on Tuesday, December 17, at Lakmahal, that the role of the political commentator and observer is not to pass judgments, but rather to lay bare the facts for the reader to decide. During the Q and A I was bluntly – and justly – critiqued by a member of the audience: no, he said, the role is not to overwhelm the reader with facts – it is to come to conclusions, to make the reader aware.

# Auld Lang Syne for the year 2024

[islandlk](http://island.lk/auld-lang-syne-for-the-year-2024/)

The year just ending – 2024 – most certainly was exceptional and will make its mark in the history of Sri Lanka. The reason is political: a drastic change in systems of governance and those wielding power, and consequently ushering a change in the economic and social condition of the nation and its people. The collective psyche of most Lankans too changed from moods of hopelessness and apathy in the face of obvious corruption and rot, to optimism. And thus my chant ‘auld lang syne’ for ‘days gone by’, ‘times past’ and ‘for the sake of old times.’
