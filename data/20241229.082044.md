Most important visitors to the country called over at Temple Trees to pay their respects to the prime minister. One of the most interesting of these occasions was the morning the West Indies cricket team called over on the initiative of Felix Goonewardene, then Editor of the Times of Ceylon.

Exceptional among them were Conrad Hunte, who spoke eloquently of his MRA (Moral Rearmament) connections and the dashing Rohan Kanhai.

During the Q and A I was bluntly ‚Äì and justly ‚Äì critiqued by a member of the audience: no, he said, the role is not to overwhelm the reader with facts ‚Äì it is to come to conclusions, to make the reader aware.

The year just ending ‚Äì 2024 ‚Äì most certainly was exceptional and will make its mark in the history of Sri Lanka.

The collective psyche of most Lankans too changed from moods of hopelessness and apathy in the face of obvious corruption and rot, to optimism. And thus my chant ‚Äòauld lang syne‚Äô for ‚Äòdays gone by‚Äô, ‚Äòtimes past‚Äô and ‚Äòfor the sake of old times.‚Äô
