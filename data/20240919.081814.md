[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Economic-stakes-of-the-2024-Presidential-election/14-766863)

Fiscally profligate promises ranging from wage increases to loan write-offs and welfare handouts are being made in a bid to win votes. Such pledges often come with a hefty price tag that the country can ill afford, especially given its still fragile economic recovery.
