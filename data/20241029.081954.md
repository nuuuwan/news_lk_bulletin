In today‚Äôs context, we observe a growing number of ex-military personnel, both officers and other ranks, transitioning into the employment world in Sri Lanka after completing their agreed service period. Unfortunately, there is a noticeable lack of proper, systematic career guidance for these individuals.

An inexperienced and understaffed Government is making appointments to various senior positions. To be true to their election promises, a process has been initiated to strip away various ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù given to holders of political office. What is common to both is the problem of managing conflicts of interest.

Concerns were raised when the CEO of a supermarket chain was appointed as chairman of Sathosa, the Government‚Äôs supermarket company. It cannot be because he lacks the necessary knowledge to run the business. In fact, it‚Äôs difficult to imagine a better qualified person to serve as CEO or as executive chair of the ailing SOE.

(The elected Executive Presidency was adopted in Sri Lanka in 1978. The original idea was mine and there is controversy about it in Sri Lanka now. I explained the Constitution in this lecture delivered in July 1991.)

The first suggestion to introduce the Executive Presidency system of Government in Sri Lanka was made by me while I was a Minister in the Dudley Senanayake Government of 1965-1970, in a speech to the Science Students Association of the Colombo University in December 1966. Some of the remarks I made then were as follows:

As fancy took him, we would attend to the papers either at the dining table or in the sitting room. It was all very informal with the household activity going on around us. Sometimes the children were at home and their conversations with each other or the mother would be an interesting break from our file work.

Such exemplary discipline and conduct of the NPP took many observers by surprise, putting to shame established parties which, when they alternated in power, invariably let loose their goons to inflict pain and misery on opposition ranks. Serving in the police from 1965 to 2000, and in retirement for two and a half decades thereafter, I was witness to violence which followed every election with monotonous regularity.
