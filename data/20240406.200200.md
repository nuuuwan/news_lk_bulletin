The trio of festivals-the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Ramadan and Easter Sunday fall within a short time of each other. The deadly Easter Sunday massacre of innocent civilians in churches and hotels in 2019 hit one of our biggest exchange earners badly.

# Racist politics raising its ugly head?

On Saturday 30 March 2024 in a YouTube message, Sujeewa Bandara, former Secretary to the ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, claimed that the people who gathered at the Mirihana house of Gotabaya seeking to remove him from power as president were not Sinhalese but Muslims.

This is absolute nonsense, calculated mischief and bankrupt politics. Video clips of the event show there were no Muslims there but all Sinhalese. Thus the statement, on the eve of presidential or general elections, seems to be aimed at rousing Sinhalese against Muslims – perhaps to come to power as they had done since the island’s independence in 1948.
