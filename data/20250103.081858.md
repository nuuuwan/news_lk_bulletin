# Oya Madu debacle – authorities gone mad?

Because they damage crops and cause other numerous damage, everyone blames the elephants and other wildlife. Many now want these animals (thankfully not the wild elephants) slaughtered. This shows our lack of fresh thinking and compassion. We do not seem to have other solutions than the easy method available – slaughter. It is the humans that encroached into jungle land, not vice versa. Today there is very little jungle area left for the wild elephants and other animals to roam. It could be around 12% of the country’s total land mass

At the moment, at least 60 elephants are stranded in the Oya Madu area including in the NLDB farm.

# Sri Lanka’s private sector needs to rethink ESG

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-private-sector-needs-to-rethink-ESG/4-771274)

Aligning business and finance with climate and biodiversity targets requires deep engagement from the private sector. Sri Lanka has seen a rise in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives in recent years – from special conferences and workshops discussing ESG, to consulting firms setting up dedicated teams to offer ESG advisory services. But will relying on ESG alone effect change? The answer, as ever, is – it’s not that straightforward.

# NPP’s great U-turn, India-China implications, emergent new left, SJB’s self-sabotage

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/NPP-s-great-U-turn-India-China-implications-emergent-new-left-SJB-s-self-sabotage/4-771267)

The AKD-led NPP government reminds me of two previous Sri Lankan governments rolled into one: the United Front coalition of 1970-1975 and the Yahapalanaya Government of 2015-2019. The LSSP-style leftist arrogance comes from the former, the UNP-style neoliberal agenda from the latter. (The only difference is that the academic and professional qualifications of the LSSP-CPSL parliamentarians were unquestionably authentic, not pretensions). Nothing in my observation of Lankan politics for 60 years tells me the current administration will be more than a one-term wonder.
