# Why the Sri Lankan economy is in crisis, while the cause is not addressed

*2024-02-28 03:31:43*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-the-Sri-Lankan-economy-is-in-crisis-while-the-cause-is-not-addressed/4-758939)

The idea in a Balance of Payments crisis, is to enhance exports to earn more foreign exchange, but the solutions put forward do not direct the economy in such a direction

Though it is now almost two years since the economic crisis blew over, Sri Lanka has not yet addressed the real cause of the crisis and is seeking solutions for the symptoms, while the cause lies elsewhere.

What is most frightening is that the solutions that are being acted on would cause greater damage to the economy to a point where it would totally be out of control, with no way out, even if we wanted to get back to a development path.
