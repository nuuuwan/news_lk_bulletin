[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Sri-Lanka-s-foreign-policy-balance-will-be-key-in-2025/4-771538)

His life serves as a profound reminder that true leadership is not defined by titles or terms but by the impact of one’s tenure. Carter’s presidency (1977–1981) and post-presidency provide valuable lessons for diplomacy, particularly in conflict resolution and principled engagement with international partners.
