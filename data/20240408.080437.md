When people who have the same first name meet up, there’s name-related humour. The more, the merrier, obviously, especially if they are good friends and enjoy friendly banter. Today I am thinking of three people who share the name Michael: Michael Tissera, Michael Sproule and Michael De Zoysa, all three who played cricket for St Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia. The first of course is the bigger name associated with the gentleman’s game.

“March Madness” is an annual ritual in the USA, the climax of the National College Basketball tournament that keeps Americans glued to their TVs for weeks. Employees in almost all offices and organizations, up to and including the White House, organize “pools” to predict the final four, the semi-finalists of this tournament, usually a monumental task. The madness regarding the events concerning Trump during March was of such confusion that it has become impossible to predict even whether America will remain a democracy after November, 2024.

# It is up to India to settle the issue of poaching in Sri Lankan waters

[islandlk](http://island.lk/it-is-up-to-india-to-settle-the-issue-of-poaching-in-sri-lankan-waters/)

Kachchativu island when I visited it in 1974 was an uninhabited and desolate place occasionally visited by fishermen to dry their nets. A small Catholic shrine stood there for protection of fishers from storms and the sea.

The Lankan newspaper in late 1960s published a photograph of what was described as a group of pilgrims from India visiting the island. Serious fishing started when Indian fishermen depleted stocks on their side of the boundary and switched to more lucrative poaching of prawns, trawling on the Sri Lankan side on the muddy bottom of the basin South of Kachchativu.
