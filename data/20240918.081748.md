# Conscience At The Polls: A Forgotten Tool To Guide Our Future

[colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/conscience-at-the-polls-a-forgotten-tool-to-guide-our-future/)

Why explore the concept of conscience now, on the verge of a presidential election? Though volumes have been written, and it has been the subject of deep discussions by psychologists, researchers, and religions, there‚Äôs an urgency to revisit it. The idea of ‚Äúconscience‚Äù often carries moral implications and is typically viewed as an inner sense of integrity. Properly harnessed, conscience‚Äîthis inner integrity itself‚Äîcan help anyone attain the highest state of mind, alongside its other functions like providing the ability to discern right from wrong. It equips any healthy individual to monitor, evaluate, and control their actions.
