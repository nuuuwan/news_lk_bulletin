The year was 2009. On 8 January, the army recaptured Palaly from the Tamil Tigers in efforts to reach the Jaffna Peninsula. I was a 10-year-old girl growing up in Colombo then and I was in year five.

That morning, I was sitting behind my desk when a teacher dashed into our classroom with terror across her face and loudly told my English teacher that Lasantha Wickrematunge had been shot. I recall my teacher being in discomfort for the remainder of the class. At the time, I didn’t quite understand the impact his death had on Sri Lanka and what his assassination was going to mean for the future of dissent in the nation.

May there emerge statesmen from among them (of either gender) in the year 2025 and after.
