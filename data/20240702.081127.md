# Imputed rental income tax: Gateway to corruption on a massive scale

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Imputed-rental-income-tax-Gateway-to-corruption-on-a-massive-scale/4-763721)

This flawed system provides the assessor a great deal of authority and gives them the opportunity to pocket a buck for themselves

By 1 April 2025 the Government proposes to implement a wealth tax by way of an “imputed rental income” on property as a precursor to a land tax. In simple terms the meaning of “imputed rental income” is the estimated rental income of a property if it were rented.

In the late 1970s, during the rising tide of neoliberal globalisation, many countries in the Global South opened up their economies to foreign capital in order to build a so-called export-oriented economy. The ethos that drove such reforms can be divided into two camps:

In China, pragmatism prevailed, with Chairman Deng Xiaoping stating, “To cross the river, feel for the stones.”

In Sri Lanka, there was an ideological faith in markets and foreign capital, with then President J.R. Jayewardene stating, “Let the robber barons come.”
