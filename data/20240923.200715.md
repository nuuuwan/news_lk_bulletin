In early 1972, the US government extended an invitation to me and to the Public Trustee, Mr. Barnes Ratwatte, to visit America under one of their leadership grants. The period was to be close upon a month. I was reluctant to ask the PM time off for such a long program. But she had heard about it, and wanted me to go. She was convinced that I needed a break, and said “At this rate you will fall ill.” This was both unselfish and gracious of her.

With a presidential election due on 21 September amid widespread economic misery, 2024 is a pivotal year for Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has enjoyed some success carrying out International Monetary Fund (IMF) reforms, but millions of Sri Lankans mired in poverty and debt have yet to feel much relief. Wickremesinghe came to power in July 2022 after his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to resign following waves of mass protest; but he owes his appointment to the Rajapaksa clan’s political party, and he has relied on it for his majority in parliament.

[islandlk](http://island.lk/statesmen-of-the-21st-century/)

It is totally unnecessary to explain the choice of subject of my article today – the day after the presidential election. We have voted and I am sure as of this morning of September 22, the new President or the next five years, is still to be announced. After all, our Sunday newspapers are printed on the Saturday night, some even on Friday. Most unlikely a stop press announcement will be made in the print media.

The definition of a statesman is: “A skilled, experienced, and respected political leader or figure.” Are any of Sri Lanka’s 39 contenders for the presidency such? A definite no is the answer I get from myself.
