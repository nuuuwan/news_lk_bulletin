# Sections of Sri Lanka’s Online Safety Act appear non-compliant with court order: HRCSL

*2024-02-09 13:51:00*

[economynextcom](https://economynext.com/sections-of-sri-lankas-online-safety-act-appear-non-compliant-with-court-order-hrcsl-150529/)

ECONOMYNEXT — The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has written to the Speaker of Parliament, pointing to sections and omissions in the Online Safety Act that HRCSL said appear to be non-compliant with the Supreme Court’s Determination on the bill.

According to the letter, dated Thursday February 08, Sections 13, 16, 19, 20, and 27 of the Online Safety Act, or the corresponding clauses of the Online Safety Bill (13, 17, 21, 22, and 31 respectively), appear non-compliant with the apex court’s determination.

The Commission said that it had highlighted in a previous communication that law enforcement authorities in Sri Lanka have encountered significant challenges in interpreting and applying existing criminal law applicable to online activity.

“We cautioned the government against proceeding with the enactment of the Bill without first engaging in meaningful institutional reform,” the letter, signed by HRCSL chairman Justice L T B Dehideniya, said.

The bill was placed on parliament’s order on October 03 and was subsequently challenged by a number of Sri Lankan citizens, after which the Supreme Court is specifically issued its determination.

Full compliance with the Court’s Determination on a Bill is crucial to guaranteeing the fundamental rights of the people of Sri Lanka, HRCSL noted.

The Supreme Court found that over 30 clauses in the Bill and certain omissions in the Bill were inconsistent with Article 12(1), and in some cases, Article 1a(1)(a) of the Constitution and determined that the Bill could only be enacted by Parliament with a special majority. However, the Court said, if all the amendments recommended by Court were introduced to the Bill during the Committee Stage of Parliament, the Bill could be enacted by Parliament with a simple majority.

“It was, therefore, incumbent on Parliament to introduce all necessary amendments recommended by Court if it was to enact the said Bill with a simple majority. If any such amendments were omitted, Parliament would be required to enact the Bill with a special majority.

“Having carefully reviewed the Online Safety Act, the Commission observes that the following sections and omissions in the Act appear to be non-compliant with the Supreme Court’s Determination on the Online Safefv Bill,” HRCSL said.

It is observed that, at pages 46 and 47 of the Supreme Courl’s Determination, the Court proposed substantive amendments to section 13 (i.e., clause 13 of the Bill) with regard to contempt of court in addition to the amendments proposed by the Hon. Attorney General.

Confer jurisdiction in terms of Article 105(3) of the Constitution to hear and determine such cases instead of conferring jurisdiction on the Magistrates Court;

Subject to the provisions of section 49(3) of the Judicature Act, No. 37 of 1979, such conferring of jurisdiction shall be in addition to the powers confemed on the District Court, Family Court, Magistrate’s Court and Primary Court by section 55 of the Judicature Act No. 37 of 1919.

The precise wording recommended by the Supreme Court does not appear to be reflected in section 13 of the Act.

The Supreme Court observed at page 5 1 of its Determination that: ‘While the ostensible aim of clause 17 [i.e., section 16 of the Act] is to protect religious sentiments from intentional and malicious falsehoods, its actual scope extends beyond the remit of “online safety” as traditionally understood’ (emphasis added)”. It also observed that ‘online safety, in its quintessential sense, is concerned with safeguarding users from immediate digital threats such as cyberbullying, phishing, scams. or exposure to harmful content. The focus is on creating a safe environment where users can navigate and interact without fear of personal harm, privacy breaches, or digital manipulation.’

The spirit of the Court’s observations appears to be that the said clause in the Bill should be deleted. However, the said clause has been retained as section 16 of the Act.

At page 53 of its Determination, the Supreme Court observed that ‘the introduction of a specific clause that criminalises the communication of false statements with intent to cause mutiny and offences against the State is overly expansive and not strictly aligned with the intended scope of the proposed law’ (emphasis added). The Courl further observes that ‘by focusing on broader national security concerns and public order. the clause deviates from the principal objective of protecting Internet users and the public frorn online harm and providing for their safety.’

The spirit of the Coutt’s observations once again appears to be that the said clause in the Bill should be deleted. However, the said clause has been retained as section 19 of the Act.

At page 61 of its Determination, the Supreme Court clearly recommended the amendment of the illustration in clause 22 of the Bill.

However, the relevant section in the Act, i.e., section 20, has retained the illustration in its original form, and the court’s recommendation has not been complied with.

At pages 59 and 60 of its Determination, the Court recommended that certain services and types of material should be exempted from liability under the Bill if they meet the following criteria:

(a) If emails are the only user-generated content enabled by the service;

(b) SMS and MMS services:1. if SMS messages are the only user-generated content enabled by the service;2. if MMS messages are the only user-generated content enabled by the service;3. if SMS messages and MMS messages are the only user-generated content enabled by the service;

(c) If one-to-one live aural communications are the only user-generated content enabled by the service;

(d) False statements, prohibited statements and other prohibited materials that are removed within six months from the date the Act comes into operation; and

(e) Any materials that have been uploaded or interfered by third parties.

We observe that the Supreme Court required all five of the above categories to be separately exempted from liability in order for the Bill to be deemed consistent with the Constitution. However, the manner in which the Act implements the Court’s recommendation appears to be erroneous.

Section 27(l) of the Act exempts categories (a), (b) and (c) above, while section 27(2) refers to categories (d) and (e). However, section 27(l) of theA ct is made subject to section 27(2). Therefore, under the Act, the categories in section27(l) are exempted only if they comply with the requirements set out in categories (d) or (e). Such a formulation is not in keeping with the Supreme Court’s recommendation that all five categories be separately exempted from the scope of the Act.

Additionally, the previous list of exempted categories in clause 3l of the original Bill (i.e., (a) an internet intermediary service; (b) a telecommunication service; (c) a service of giving public access to the internet; or (d) a computer resource service), are now exempted under section 27(l) of the Act only if they comply with section 27(2)of the Act, i.e., if the relevant material is removed within six months of the Act coming into operation, or if the material was uploaded or interfered with by third parties.

Prior to amendments being introduced during the Committee Stage of parliament, the above-mentioned service providers would not have been required to remove material within six months of the Act coming into operation. However, section 27(2)of the Act now requires such removal in order for an internet service provider to be exempted.

We accordingly note that section 27 doesnot fully comply with the recommendation of the Supreme Court.

The Commission is deeply concerned about the above omissions in the Online Safety Act in terms of the Act’s full compliance with the Supreme Cou(‘s Determination. Any such omission, and consequently, any remaining inconsistency with the Constitution, would have required that the Online Safety Bill be enacted only with a special majority in Parliament. Therefore, the failure to ensure full compliance with the Court’s determination may give occasion to serious concerns over whether the Act, in its current form, received the requisite number of votes in Parliament.

# President Ranil meets with India’s foreign minister while in Australia

*2024-02-10 08:55:00*

[adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97157/president-ranil-meets-with-indias-foreign-minister-while-in-australia)

# Indian Ocean stability requires early end to Gaza war - President

*2024-02-09 23:42:00*

[adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97152/indian-ocean-stability-requires-early-end-to-gaza-war-president)

President Ranil Wickremesinghe says the Indian Ocean Region’s stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and a guarantee for the security of the state of Israel.

He made this remark while delivering the keynote address at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, Australia on Friday (Feb.09).

Wickremesinghe hit out at the United States for supporting the war in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. “The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the [Indian Ocean] region.”

Commenting further, the President emphasized that the hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time.

The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony, and thereby further weakening the US, Wickremesinghe said underscoring the fact that Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war.

With regard to the recent geopolitical developments and their impact on the Indian Ocean Region, the President said these have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean, he added.

Russia has now found new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean due to the Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on the resource-rich economy, the President continued. “For example, Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa.

“China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits.”

“It is a great pleasure to be here in Perth for the 7th edition of the Indian Ocean Conference. I thank the Australian Government, for the hospitality afforded to all of us. I also thank the India Foundation for once again bringing us together. The theme of this Conference – “Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean”- could not be timelier and more appropriate.

The Australasian continent is unique in that it has borders with both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceans. Perth played a crucial role in the history of Sri Lanka – Australia relations. During World War II, Royal Canadian Air Force, Catalina Flying Boats, traversed the expanse of the Indian Ocean, connecting Perth with Koggala Air Base in Ceylon. The only air link between the Indian subcontinent and Australia. Known as flights of the double sunrise, they operated a non-stop route upto 32 hours in radio silence, to ensure the success of a critical air route during World War II for the Allies.

The Japanese attacks in April 1942 on the Indian Ocean specially Ceylon was described by Churchill as the most dangerous moment of the war highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean to the British Empire. I was just talking with Dr. Balakrishnan and he said there were no carrier battles in the Indian Ocean for the simple reason that the Japanese sank the only British carrier.

Let me highlight a few important developments which I hope will make a contribution to your deliberations.

Firstly, historically speaking, the Indian Ocean is multipolar and has resisted domination by a single power. This multipolarity is a reflection of the essence of the Indian Ocean region and its people. As Asia emerged from colonialism the newly independent countries of Asia ie. Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan convened the Bandung Conference in 1955 to oppose colonialism in all its forms. The conference declaration to oppose big power rivalry in turn led to the Non Aligned Movement. Since then the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by the spirit of Bandung. It has never became a part of the US Hub and Spoke system.

The past two decades has seen the emergence of diverse framings of the Indian Ocean region and a flurry of diplomatic activity articulating various policy positions, tilts, and frameworks. What is clear is that no single, objective geopolitical construct has emerged, and we are left instead with a contested vision with multiple interpretations.

The key frameworks that have emerged include in addition to IORA, the Indo-Pacific, the BRI, the QUAD, and the BRICS. There are also regional organizations including ASEAN, ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), ACD (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) BIMSTEC, SAARC, GCC, Arab League, OIC, SADC, EAC and SCO that have been established. Additionally, we have the operational arrangements that deal with specific areas of cooperation including RCEP, IONS, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, IOTC, Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), MASE, four regional Information Fusion Centres (Singapore, India, Seychelles and Madagascar), and the CGPCS (Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia).

Along with these frameworks and groupings, we also see an increased militarization of the Indian Ocean which is redefining power balances and alliances. In the maritime space we see a building up in naval capabilities in India, and with USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China all increasing their naval presence significantly. Therefore, balancing between the great power rivalries is becoming an increasingly more complex task. As a result, the space for manoeuvrability for littoral states is shrinking fast as this rivalry in the Indian Ocean region intensifies and spills over into decision-making on political, economic and security issues. The proverbial question to choose one over the other is perennially hanging over us.

Secondly, the geopolitical developments have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean. The Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on Russia has resulted in the resource-rich economy finding new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean. For example, Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa.

China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits.

The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the region. The hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony thereby further weakening the US. The Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by,

a. the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and

Thirdly, the recent attacks on commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi rebels, is a challenge to the ‘Freedom of Navigation’. We have to ensure access and mobility in the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, we also face the threat of Somali Pirates, once again. The safety of undersea cables and critical infrastructure are also facing additional threats. The presence of drugs in the Indian Ocean and Human Smuggling has increased. IUU fishing still takes place. These threats present challenges to the Freedom of Navigation. We need to refocus on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka offers to recommence the discussions on the Freedom of Nation in the Indian Ocean.

Fourth, is expanding connectivity. According to estimates there will be an eight-fold increase in the GDP of India and Indonesia by 2050. Similar increases are expected in some of the other countries in South and West Asia. This requires additional port capacities and new transport routes. The Suez Canal may not be sufficient. In this regard India’s two new connectivity initiatives are welcome. Firstly, the India (Mumbai) – Iran – Russia corridor and secondly the India (Mumbai) – Middle East – Europe corridor. Similarly, there are connectivity initiatives taking place in the Bay of Bengal. Work has already commenced on the Chongqing – Kyaukphyu corridor giving access to Western China. Thailand is planning the Kra land bridge connecting the Gulf of Siam with the Bay of Bengal. India and Sri Lanka are commencing feasibility studies on land connectivity between the two countries making Sri Lanka a Regional Logistics Hub with Colombo and Trincomalee ports available to South India.

The Indian Ocean Conference theme this year “Towards a more stable and sustainable Indian Ocean” highlights the two key areas which require our focus. What I have outlined before, dealt primarily with pursuing stability of the region. There is an equally serious, more immediate and existential threat that looms and that is the Climate Crisis.

Experts have revealed that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than the other oceans around the world. The levels of warming are estimated to be three times higher than in the Pacific Ocean and coastal areas across the IOR will experience continuous rise in sea levels and face severe coastal erosion. The Indian Ocean is also rising at a level of 3.7 millimetres annually and extreme sea disasters are inevitable. The island states of the IOR are vulnerable and have to be provided with adequate resources to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes at sea also affect monsoon patterns and in turn impact on agriculture and food security across the Indian Ocean region. They also impact on the biodiversity and in turn on food and livelihood of people of the littoral states.

The Indian Ocean presents opportunities in terms of ecology. Not only is it our biggest sink for Carbon, but it also provides potential for mitigating the climate crisis, through offshore wind, solar, and wave energy. Through seaweed farming and mangrove cultivation, we can increase the sequestration of Carbon. Sustainable exploitation of our Ocean’s resources is critical for our survival, as the Ocean provides for our future.

At COP 28 Sri Lanka proposed three key initiatives, (1) the Tropical Belt Initiative, including the Indian Ocean (2) The International Climate Change University and the Climate Justice Forum. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. The Climate Justice Forum aims to accelerate financing of losses and damages and includes debt justice as an essential component of the overall solution. Any proposals for mitigation and adaptation interventions must take into account the debt component faced by Climate-vulnerable and developing countries.

We are living in uncertain times. The stability we had taken for granted since the end of WWII and the Cold War is unravelling. Globalisation is being challenged as is multilateralism. The Climate Crisis is affecting prospects for trade and economic development around the world. It is impacting on food security, livelihoods, supply chains, biodiversity and maritime transportation. Either we can wait for global developments to dictate our fate or unite, so that we may chart our own course.

Creating a safer ocean environment by building confidence and predictability among users and enhancing ocean situational awareness will be key to maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean. The main platform that can undertake this important task is the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Ensuring a peaceful and secure Indian Ocean would facilitate sustainable use of oceans for the economic and social benefit of coastal and littoral states.

An overarching architecture for the Indian Ocean that deals with critical issues is required. The basis for such a structure is already in existence including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) and the recently adopted BBNJ agreement in 2023 on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or the High Seas Treaty.

A Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation and over flight and unimpeded commerce and similar guiding principles on dealing with the climate crisis and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean are a necessity. Only the leaders of the IORA countries can ensure that these measures are translated to the creation of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean region. Therefore the responsibility lies with us.

# Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan’s PTI neck-and-neck in first results

*2024-02-09 11:46:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/international/Nawaz-Sharif-and-Imran-Khans-PTI-neck-and-neck-in-first-results/107-276668)

Pakistan, Feb 09 (Independent) With results from Pakistan’s election trickling in slower than normal, candidates backed by former prime minister Imran Khan’s party appeared to be doing better than expected, as he was seen neck-and-neck with the favourite Nawaz Sharif.

Preliminary election results normally emerge within a few hours in Pakistan but were hit by long delays overnight, only adding to existing fears of poll rigging.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced results of just eight of the 265 contested seats in parliament on its website by morning.

Mr Sharif’s PML-N is leading in four seats while members of Mr Khan’s PTI party who ran as independents won three seats, and the Pakistan Peoples Party of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari got just one.

The election commission cited an unspecified “internet issue” for the long delay of more than 13 hours of counting the votes as the PTI party alleged that the “overwhelming mandate of the people of Pakistan is being stolen”.

Yesterday polls opened from 8am to 5pm for more than 128 million registered voters, amid a blackout of mobile network and data services and accusations of rigging and unfair conditions for members of Mr Khan’s party.

Poll-related violence and terrorist attacks left at least 40 people dead over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, across a series of incidents.

Any party needs 133 seats in parliament for a simple majority but many analysts believe the vote may not produce a clear winner.



# Pakistan election: Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif each claim advantage

*2024-02-10 08:03:00*

[adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97156/pakistan-election-imran-khan-and-nawaz-sharif-each-claim-advantage)

The jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has claimed victory in Thursday’s general election and called on his supporters to celebrate.

Independent candidates linked to him have won most seats so far, with the majority of seats declared.

But another ex-PM, Nawaz Sharif, says his party has emerged the largest and urges others to join him in coalition.

No group or party appears on course to win an overall majority. The final results are yet to be announced.

In a staunch video message posted on X created using AI, Mr Khan claimed his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had won a “landslide victory” despite what he has called a crackdown on his party.

He is currently in jail having been convicted in cases he says are politically motivated.

The success of the PTI-linked candidates was unexpected, with most experts agreeing that Mr Sharif - believed to be backed by the country’s powerful military - was the clear favourite.

But the PTI is not a recognised party after being barred from running in the election, so technically Mr Sharif’s PML-N is the largest official political group.

So now the political horse-trading begins in earnest, which means it could still be a while before anyone is able to claim outright victory.

In a speech on Friday, Mr Sharif acknowledged that he did not have the numbers to form a government alone. But addressing supporters outside his party’s headquarters in the city of Lahore, he urged other candidates to join him in a coalition and said he could remove the country from difficult times.

Speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Friday, Mr Khan’s former special assistant Zulifkar Bukhari said: “Knowing Imran Khan and knowing the ethos of our political party PTI, I don’t think we’ll be making any coalition, forming a government with any of the main parties.

“However, we will be forming a coalition... to be in parliament - not as an independent but under one banner, one party”.

And asked about whether Mr Khan could potentially be released, Mr Bukhari said: “I think the minute we go to the high court and the supreme court we are extremely confident that he will be released, and a lot of the charges - if not all - will be thrown out on legal merit and procedural merit.”

As results trickled in, the UK and US voiced concerns over restrictions on electoral freedoms during the vote.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK urged authorities in Pakistan “to uphold fundamental human rights including free access to information, and the rule of law”.

In a statement, he went on to express “regret that not all parties were formally permitted to contest the elections”.

Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller criticised what he described as “undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly” during Pakistan’s electoral process.

As many as 128 million people were registered to cast their votes, almost half of whom were under the age of 35. More than 5,000 candidates - of whom just 313 are women - contested 266 directly-elected seats in the 336-member National Assembly.

Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Maleeha Lodhi, said Pakistan “desperately” needs political stability to address what she described as “the worst economic crisis in its history”.

But, in a hopeful note, Ms Lodhi said Pakistan’s voter numbers show a “belief in the democratic process”.
