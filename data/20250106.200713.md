# Gaddafi‚Äôs armed bodyguards create a scene at the Non-Aligned Conference

*2025-01-06 15:00:00*

[islandlk](http://island.lk/gaddafis-armed-bodyguards-create-a-scene-at-the-non-aligned-conference/)

(Excerpted from the autobiography of MDD Peiris, Secretary to the Prime Minister)

I shall not deal with the day to day work of the Non-Aligned Conference in plenary sessions and in committees and the substantive issues that were discussed and debated. I was not directly involved in these aspects, and there would be others more competent than I to write about such matters. My job was one of co-ordination, troubleshooting, and the prevention or resolution of any issue that could mar the proceedings of the conference.

# A statesman and his stance on the merits, if any, of British colonialism

*2025-01-06 14:57:00*

[islandlk](http://island.lk/a-statesman-and-his-stance-on-the-merits-if-any-of-british-colonialism/)

I overcame the thought it was inauspicious to write about a death as Nan‚Äôs first column for the New Year. But it is a tribute to a great man and a life lived well and successfully, turning a huge country from economic depression to prosperity. Hence, presenting an inspiring human beacon to be followed to our country, now struggling to get out of economic difficulties with new leaders at the helm, is good. May there emerge statesmen from among them (of either gender) in the year 2025 and after.

# How to avoid Sri Lanka‚Äôs rice crises made by government controls

We have seen the worst leadership being demonstrated at the recently concluded T 20 World Cup tournament. This poor leadership resulted in Sri Lanka failing in all departments of the game.
