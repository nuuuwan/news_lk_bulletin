The AKD-led NPP government reminds me of two previous Sri Lankan governments rolled into one: the United Front coalition of 1970-1975 and the Yahapalanaya Government of 2015-2019. The LSSP-style leftist arrogance comes from the former, the UNP-style neoliberal agenda from the latter. (The only difference is that the academic and professional qualifications of the LSSP-CPSL parliamentarians were unquestionably authentic, not pretensions). Nothing in my observation of Lankan politics for 60 years tells me the current administration will be more than a one-term wonder.
