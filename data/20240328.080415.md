“A. K. Dissanayake increasingly has the demeanour of a national leader…”Prof. Mick Moore, OBE

‘Why Bharat Matters’, matters. The new book by one of the world’s most outstanding and admired foreign ministers, India’s Dr. S. Jaishankar, makes clear the centrality of Ramayana mythology within ‘Bharat’ as BJP’s India and BJP worldview. Cosmology dominates ideology.

In an ambitious exegetical enterprise, Dr. Jaishankar strives to confer the (non-secular) Ramayana a methodological and intellectual status as a strategic text that is implicitly above Kautilya’s (secular) Arthashasthra, a Realist classic. A tough sell, that.

With the heat situation hardly showing signs of improving, I thought of giving my readers something different this week.

Now place the pineapple chunks, mango chunks, banana, and coconut water in a blender. (If you are using spinach, add the handful of spinach as that would give an extra nutritional boost.)

Blend all ingredients, on high speed, until you achieve a smooth consistency. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add more coconut water to reach your desired thickness.
