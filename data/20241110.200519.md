When my son was 11 years old and in middle school, he chose to write about his grandfather, starting his essay with the statement, ‚Äúmy grandfather is an enigma.‚Äù I am not sure whether to his young mind my father was so much a puzzle, being both a super -cool grandpa and an exacting teacher, or just simply unpredictable. My father was someone who could relate to his grandchildren only when they were old enough to debate the merits of the separation of state and church or play a championship game of chess. But he also had wonderful adventures which fired my son‚Äôs young imagination.
