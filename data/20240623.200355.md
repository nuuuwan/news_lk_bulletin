# Unbundling The CEB II: Ranil & The Politics Of Reforming SOEs

[colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/unbundling-the-ceb-ii-ranil-the-politics-of-reforming-soes/)

It is an old truism in policy analysis that there is nothing purely ‘technical’ in policy decisions. Every policy decision has a political aspect to it. Technical analysis is necessary and useful to identify and evaluate feasible options, including the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, what is selected or rejected is a political matter based on political preferences. There is nothing wrong with that. What gets to be objectionable is when decisions are made to reach outcomes to benefit some or disbenefit someone else based on inappropriate considerations.
