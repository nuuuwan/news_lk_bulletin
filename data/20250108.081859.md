The 16th anniversary of the assassination of The Sunday Leader founder Editor-in-Chief Lasantha Wickrematunge, which falls on 8 January, will be marked with a service at his graveside.

Family, friends, former colleagues and others will gather at Borella Kanatte at 9 a.m. to mark the anniversary and remember Lasantha.

Assassinated on 8 January 2009, Lasantha was one of Sri Lanka’s leading journalists and an outspoken critic of the then Rajapaksa Government. He was attacked as he drove to work and later died of his injuries.

The brazen attack was carried out by two gunmen on motorcycles in the middle of morning-rush-hour traffic.

The year was 2009. On 8 January, the army recaptured Palaly from the Tamil Tigers in efforts to reach the Jaffna Peninsula. I was a 10-year-old girl growing up in Colombo then and I was in year five.

That morning, I was sitting behind my desk when a teacher dashed into our classroom with terror across her face and loudly told my English teacher that Lasantha Wickrematunge had been shot. I recall my teacher being in discomfort for the remainder of the class. At the time, I didn’t quite understand the impact his death had on Sri Lanka and what his assassination was going to mean for the future of dissent in the nation.

The External Resources Department has made a formal request to extend the project, but that’s been routinely turned down.
