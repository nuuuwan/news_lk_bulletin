In my maidenly era, and even earlier, most of us entered marriage with stars in our eyes. If not always stars, at least happy expectations of a cozily comfortable home life where everything fell into place and nothing other than an occasional husbandly tantrum disturbed the peace of the day. No one told us that men had quirks or that they had strange, indeed offbeat foibles.

After all, how could a mother anticipate what peculiarities her daughter’s charming fiance was going to exhibit once he had exchanged this role for that of a husband who required mollycoddling in the same manner his doting mother had provided all his life.

Growing up in Sri Lanka in the 60s and 70s, our ambition was to secure a government job, retire by age 55, and enjoy a good pension.

We scattered across the globe, embracing diverse cultures and values. In the USA, particularly, we’ve been conditioned to believe that age is just a number and that life is endless, with us as the Energizer Bunnies, going on forever.
