The historically unprecedented multiethnic vote for the National People’s Alliance in November 2024 should not be reduced to a superficial celebration of “we are all Sri Lankans” or an invitation to forget the past and move on. Such an approach ignores the deep historical injustices symbolized by Independence Day celebrations, which cannot be undone by merely electing a new government. Instead, our vote must express our collective willingness to fundamentally free history from its injustices—a call to rethink and transform the meaning of independence into a day of making history that we can meaningfully celebrate.
