# Culture Shock in Iraq

*2024-05-12 02:29:00*

[islandlk](http://island.lk/culture-shock-in-iraq/)

My first impressions of Iraq were positive. Upon arrival at Saddam International Airport, the opulence and modernity juxtaposed against the backdrop of a country rebuilding itself after a war. The warm reception and luxurious accommodations at Hotel Babylon Oberoi spoke volumes about the resilience and hospitality of the Iraqi people. The five-star standards of Hotel Babylon Oberoi, and facilities provided to my family at a corner suite facing Tigris River, were all positive. I was pleasantly surprised as these observations exceeded my expectations.

Until about 50 years ago, a rice-and-curry lunch in Sri Lanka was incomplete without the side relish of jaadi theldala (sauteed cured fish). Some ate white rice with a piece of jaadi before serving other curries onto their plates. Amma (my mother) prepared a special Jaadi dish with tomatoes and large onion rings for Sunday lunch. She got jaadi  from Aachcho (my grandmother), who boasted that her jaadi was the best in the Kalutara district. Aachcho produced jaadi at home twice a year. I remember her making Jaadi in 1963. I was then 12 years old and was on holiday at her place.

# The fig leaf of humanitarianism

*2024-05-11 21:23:00*

[islandlk](http://island.lk/the-fig-leaf-of-humanitarianism/)

As each day passes and the death toll rises in Gaza, the West’s complicity in Israeli atrocities becomes clearer and sharper. South Africa’s case against Israel is a clear indictment of the Global North’s inaction regarding those atrocities. Israel’s defence team has attempted to rationalise what Israeli forces are doing in Gaza, but this has effectively been undermined by the Israeli government itself: each day, its official social media channels tweet or post one ridiculous claim against not just South Africa, but also the ICJ.
