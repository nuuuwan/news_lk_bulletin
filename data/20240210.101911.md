# Pakistan elections: Imran Khan, Nawaz Sharif both claim wins

*2024-02-10 08:40:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Pakistan-elections-Imran-Khan-Nawaz-Sharif-both-claim-wins/108-276730)

ISLAMABAD, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Former Pakistani prime ministers and bitter rivals Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan on Friday both declared victory in elections marred by delayed results and militant attacks, throwing the country into further political turmoil.

Sharif's party won the most seats by a single party in Thursday's election, but supporters of imprisoned Khan, who ran as independents instead of as a single bloc after his party was barred from the polls, won the most seats overall.

Sharif said his party would talk to other groups to form a coalition government as it had failed to win a clear majority on its own.

Sharif's announcement came after more than three-quarters of the 265 seats had declared results, more than 24 hours after polling ended on Thursday when 28 people were killed in militant attacks.

Analysts had predicted there may be no clear winner, adding to the woes of a country struggling to recover from an economic crisis while it grapples with rising militancy in a deeply polarised political environment.

The results showed independents, most of them backed by Khan, had won the most seats - 98 of the 245 counted by 1830 GMT.

Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) won 69 while the Pakistan People's Party of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated premier Benazir Bhutto, got 51.

"Pakistan Muslim League is the single-largest party in the country today after the elections and it is our duty to bring this country out of the whirlpool," Sharif told a crowd of supporters gathered outside his home in the eastern city of Lahore.

"Whoever has got the mandate, whether independents or parties, we respect the mandate they have got," he said. "We invite them to sit with us and help this wounded nation get back on its feet."

Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party released an audio-visual message created using artificial intelligence and shared on his X social media account.

In the message, which is usually delivered by word through his lawyers, Khan, 71, rejected Sharif's claim to victory, congratulated his supporters on "winning" the election and urged them to celebrate and protect their vote.

"I trusted that you all would come out to vote - and you honoured that trust and your massive turnout has shocked everyone," the message said, adding no one would accept Sharif's claim because he had won fewer seats and because there had been rigging in the polls. Former cricket superstar Khan has been in jail since August, and was convicted three times in six days in the leadup to the polls for 10, 14 and seven years in cases related to state secrets, graft and an unlawful marriage.

Sharif, 74, a three-time former premier, returned from four years of self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom late last year, having contested the last election from a jail cell on a graft conviction.

He was considered the front-runner to lead the country, having buried a long-running feud with the powerful military.

Sharif said his party would have preferred to win a majority of its own but in the absence of that would get in touch with others, including former President Asif Ali Zardari of PPP, to open negotiations as early as Friday night.

In its first reaction, a senior aide of Khan said PTI leaders would hold talks among themselves and also meet Khan in jail on Saturday to discuss the results, Geo News reported.

Results of the vote have been unusually delayed, which the caretaker government ascribed to the suspension of mobile phone services - a security measure ahead of the election.

Independent members cannot form a government on their own under Pakistan's complex election system which also includes reserved seats that will be allotted to parties based on their winnings.

But independents have the option to join any party after the elections.

"A timely announcement of the results, leading to a smooth formation of a new government, will reduce policy and political uncertainty," Moody's Investors Service said. "This is crucial for the country that is facing very challenging macroeconomic conditions."

The delay in the announcement of results was unusual for Pakistan. Karachi's stock index and Pakistan's sovereign bonds fell because of the uncertainty.

The main electoral battle had been expected to be between candidates backed by Khan, whose PTI won the last national election, and the PML-N. Khan believes the powerful military is behind a crackdown to hound his party out of existence, while analysts and opponents say Sharif is being backed by the generals.

The military has dominated the nuclear-armed country either directly or indirectly in its 76 years of independence from Britain but for several years it has maintained it does not interfere in politics.

Analysts say a coalition government will struggle to tackle multiple challenges - foremost being seeking a new bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the current arrangement expires in three weeks.

A coalition government "would probably be unstable, weak" and "the big loser ... will be the army", said Marvin Weinbaum, Director of Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Middle East Institute in Washington.

"Because the army really has staked its reputation on its ability to deliver this vote."

The election was expected to help resolve the crises Pakistan has been dealing with but a fractured verdict "could very well be the basis for even deeper exposure to forces which would create instability", he said.



# Reduce electricity tariffs by considerable amount: Sajith urges Govt.

*2024-02-10 08:16:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Reduce-electricity-tariffs-by-considerable-amount-Sajith-urges-Govt/108-276726)

Colombo, Feb 10 (Daily Mirror) - Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday urged the government to reduce the electricity tariff by a considerable amount after analysing the data of the Verité Research and Committee on Public Finance on electricity tariff, which is said to be higher in South Asia.

The Opposition Leader told parliament that, according to the data on the surveys, Sri Lankans pay approximately 2.5 to 3 times more for electricity compared to their counterparts in other South Asian nations.

He said the government increased electricity tariffs on several occasions in the recent past and that it had negatively affected consumers, the public, industrial sector and business sector.

“We heard that the government is planning to reduce electricity tariff by 4 per cent. It is not at all suf­ficient. We urge the government to reduce the electricity tariff by a considerable amount,” he said.



# Pakistan election: Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif each claim advantage

*2024-02-10 08:03:00*

[adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/97156/pakistan-election-imran-khan-and-nawaz-sharif-each-claim-advantage)

The jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has claimed victory in Thursday’s general election and called on his supporters to celebrate.

Independent candidates linked to him have won most seats so far, with the majority of seats declared.

But another ex-PM, Nawaz Sharif, says his party has emerged the largest and urges others to join him in coalition.

No group or party appears on course to win an overall majority. The final results are yet to be announced.

In a staunch video message posted on X created using AI, Mr Khan claimed his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had won a “landslide victory” despite what he has called a crackdown on his party.

He is currently in jail having been convicted in cases he says are politically motivated.

The success of the PTI-linked candidates was unexpected, with most experts agreeing that Mr Sharif - believed to be backed by the country’s powerful military - was the clear favourite.

But the PTI is not a recognised party after being barred from running in the election, so technically Mr Sharif’s PML-N is the largest official political group.

So now the political horse-trading begins in earnest, which means it could still be a while before anyone is able to claim outright victory.

In a speech on Friday, Mr Sharif acknowledged that he did not have the numbers to form a government alone. But addressing supporters outside his party’s headquarters in the city of Lahore, he urged other candidates to join him in a coalition and said he could remove the country from difficult times.

Speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Friday, Mr Khan’s former special assistant Zulifkar Bukhari said: “Knowing Imran Khan and knowing the ethos of our political party PTI, I don’t think we’ll be making any coalition, forming a government with any of the main parties.

“However, we will be forming a coalition... to be in parliament - not as an independent but under one banner, one party”.

And asked about whether Mr Khan could potentially be released, Mr Bukhari said: “I think the minute we go to the high court and the supreme court we are extremely confident that he will be released, and a lot of the charges - if not all - will be thrown out on legal merit and procedural merit.”

The third biggest party appears to be the Pakistan People’s Party led by Bilawal Bhutto, the son of PM Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated in 2007.

As results trickled in, the UK and US voiced concerns over restrictions on electoral freedoms during the vote.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK urged authorities in Pakistan “to uphold fundamental human rights including free access to information, and the rule of law”.

In a statement, he went on to express “regret that not all parties were formally permitted to contest the elections”.

Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller criticised what he described as “undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly” during Pakistan’s electoral process.

He also cited “attacks on media workers” and “restrictions on access to the internet and telecommunication services” as reasons to worry about “allegations of interference” in the process.

Many analysts have said this is among Pakistan’s least credible elections.

Voters in Lahore told the BBC that the internet blackout on polling day meant it was not possible to book taxis to go and vote, while others said they could not co-ordinate when to head to polling stations with their family members.

An interior ministry spokesman said the blackouts were necessary for security reasons.

Support from the military in Pakistan is seen as important to succeed politically, and analysts believe Mr Sharif and his party currently have their backing, despite their differences in the past.

Maya Tudor, associate professor at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, said the lead taken by Imran Khan’s PTI was “shocking” in the context of the country’s past.

“A win would be remarkable - in every single other election in Pakistan’s recent history, the military’s preferred candidate has won,” Dr Tudor explained.

As many as 128 million people were registered to cast their votes, almost half of whom were under the age of 35. More than 5,000 candidates - of whom just 313 are women - contested 266 directly-elected seats in the 336-member National Assembly.

Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States, Maleeha Lodhi, said Pakistan “desperately” needs political stability to address what she described as “the worst economic crisis in its history”.

But, in a hopeful note, Ms Lodhi said Pakistan’s voter numbers show a “belief in the democratic process”.

# NGOs spend billions unchecked, new law soon to monitor them

*2024-02-10 06:26:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/NGOs-spend-billions-unchecked-new-law-soon-to-monitor-them/108-276725)

Colombo, Feb 10 (Daily Mirror) -  In the wake of reports that as much as over half of funds received by various NGOs are spent without any monitoring, the government is in the final stage of evolving a new law that provides for compulsory registration of all such organizations with the National NGO Secretariat, an official said.

The final draft of the new law titled ‘Non-governmental Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Bill is now ready. It has now been circulated among the NGOs and individual activists for their views before being presented to the Cabinet for approval. They have been given a period of three weeks for submission of their views, if any, to be incorporated in the bill before enactment.

Director General of the Secretariat for Sanjeewa Wimalagunarathna told Daily Mirror yesterday that the bill, once enacted, would provide for compulsory registration of the NGOs for operation. Currently, there are numerous organizations operating without any supervision as they have not been registered with the Secretariat.

“Last year, the NGOs registered with the Secretariat received as much as Rs.33 billion in foreign funding for their projects in the country. However, there are many unregistered NGOs operating in the country. Altogether, we believe as much as Rs.100 billion is received in funding annually. It means a large amount of NGO funds is spent without any monitoring by the government,” he said.

Responding to a question about the NGOs raising concerns and asking for another three months to submit their proposals, he said these organizations had been given ample time to do so, and he was not in a position to extend the current three-week period granted them again.

“They submitted their proposals for the last time on January 31, 2023. Now we have drafted the bill incorporating them. In the past, there were two draft bills –one worked out in 2017 and the other in 2020. We have taken into account the content of these two past bills and worked out the latest versions while accommodating the views of the NGOs. Therefore, we cannot grant any further time,” he said.

He stressed the need to enact such a law to contain money laundering and terrorist financing in the guise of NGO activities.

“It is a requirement stipulated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to have laws to deal with money laundering and terrorist financing. Therefore, we have to enact this bill. It will be done in two months’ time,” he said.

At the moment, there are 1,786 registered NGOs operating at national level, 1,636 at district levels and 38,524 at divisional levels.

# Prof. Siva urges Sri Lankan expatriates to invest in nation’s youth

*2024-02-10 01:21:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Prof-Siva-urges-Sri-Lankan-expatriates-to-invest-in-nations-youth/108-276719)

A Prominent American academic of Sri Lankan origin, Prof. Siva Sivanathan, called on Sri Lankan expatriates to be part of Sri Lanka’s growth story by contributing a portion of their earnings to the island nation’s children and youth.

“Sri Lanka can be developed if all its expatriates contribute 5 percent of what they have earned for the future of Sri Lankan children and youth,” Prof. Sivananthan told journalists in Colombo this week.

“I, being a student of Hindu College Jaffna and University of Peradeniya, wanted to give back something to Sri Lanka and thereby, was successful in introducing a diploma programme in renewable energy together with the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority. The children who study this programme are usually employed by the time they graduate,” he said.

Dr. Sivananthan called for reforms in the education sector in Sri Lanka and specifically called for a quick transfer of students from the GCE Ordinary Level examination to the Advanced Level examination.

He also called for a quick transfer of students from schools to universities.

“Usually, a child who completes the Ordinary Level examination will have to stay at home for months till his results are released. A child has to spend more than a year after he completes his Advanced Level examination to enter a university. Sri Lanka will have to rectify this shortcoming,” he pointed out.

According to him, a key mistake Sri Lanka makes is getting children to become doctors, engineers and other professionals, while better prospects are available in fields such as renewable energy.

Further, going through an internship programme must be made mandatory for Sri Lankan children, either on a voluntary basis or for a salary, as it would help in gaining the necessary experience, he said.

Dr. Sivanathan was born in Jaffna and obtained his BSC from the University of Peradeniya. He then received his PHD in physics from UIC USA, in the 1980s. He is a proponent of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and a firm believer in solar and renewable energy sources. He is the founder of InSPIRE, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to bringing solar energy to the forefront. (By Yohan Perera)

Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Duminda Hulangamuwa welcoming President Ranil Wickremesinghe

The Sri Lanka-Thailand Business Forum, organised in collaboration with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Thailand in Sri Lanka, the Department of International Trade Promotion, The Ministry of Commerce Thailand, the Ministry of Trade Commerce and Food Security, The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber’s Sri Lanka - Greater Mekong Business Council (SLGMBC), on 3 February 2024, attracted high-level government and private sector participation.

Attended by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister of Thailand Srettha Thavisin, with the participation of over 200 corporate representatives and a 21-member business delegation from Thailand, the Forum followed the signing of the Sri Lanka – Thailand Free Trade Agreement.

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and Thailand holds significant importance for Sri Lanka, addressing critical challenges in the country’s export sector, especially the lack of both export diversification and varied export destinations.

The reduction in tariffs for traditional exports like tea, apparel, coconut, rubber, cinnamon, and fishery products is expected to provide a boost to Sri Lanka’s export growth in 2024, and the FTA is also expected to stimulate growth in services exports, particularly in sectors like construction, education, computer and IT services, tourism, and environmental services.

The Investment Chapter of the FTA is anticipated to attract Thai investment, addressing technology and skills gaps in sectors such as automobile, electronics, and pharma, while visa-free travel provisions will further reduce business costs for the private sector in both countries, facilitating easier setup and fostering tourism links.

The Ceylon Chamber and the SLGMBC were instrumental in facilitating a series of business-to-business meetings amongst the Sri Lankan companies and the Thai business delegation, serving as the first platform to foster bilateral relationships following the FTA. Expressing interest across a spectrum of sectors, including food processing, healthcare, energy, hospitality, tourism, fisheries, agriculture, and manufacturing, the Thai delegation actively engaged with their Sri Lankan business counterparts to explore mutually beneficial opportunities for collaboration.

The Ceylon Chamber views the FTA with Thailand as a catalyst for economic growth and trade diversification for Sri Lanka, positioning it strategically within the broader Asia-Pacific region.
