If we do not borrow externally in 2028, we will either default in 2028 or have to cut down our imports drastically

Many Sri Lankans may inquire why we should borrow from bondholders again and if this is detrimental. Allow me to explain as simply as possible. It would be ideal if we never had to borrow from international capital markets. However, Sri Lanka does not have a choice at present.
