Everything needs to have a reason, framed in its purpose. Without reason and purpose, life and everything that is part of living decays into meaninglessness. Mark Twain brilliantly explained, “The two most important days in life are the day you were born and the day you find out why.” That truth applies as much to life as to business. There was a time – when it was thought private enterprise – businesses pursuing their own interests – would contribute to a better outcome for society as a whole. It was thought that individuals in pursuit of profit would inadvertently contribute to the economic well-being of society as a whole.

# Religious misrepresentation and Israeli bloodlust in Rafah

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Religious-misrepresentation-and-Israeli-bloodlust-in-Rafah/172-282113)

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for the obliteration of Rafah, Deir al-Balah, and Nuseirat.

In the dark ages one could, to an extent excuse bloodlust and calls for the eradication of an entire race of a particular people. People of that day and age were primitive. Bloodthirsty men of the cloth called for the eradication of particular peoples whom they saw as their enemies. They used God’s name as a cover for their hatred.

The fear of so-called ‘Holy men’ who had private discourses with the deities led them to follow the dictates of those crazed characters.

Two days ago this newspaper highlighted the story of a Woman Police Constable (WPC) being arrested for picking the handbag of a shopper in Kandy. Not many of us citizens were shocked or dumbfounded. After all, this was ‘merely’ a case of a so-called ‘law keeper’ breaking a law.

We as a nation know how our country’s leaders brought our people and the nation to a position of bankruptcy through corrupt practices. The political leaders of this country are not much different from political leaders in even the richest country in the world.

If the Government of Sri Lanka desires to streamline the inefficient and corruption-laden immigration and emigration authorities, one can’t find fault.

The Immigration Department is infested with crooks that have fought against even the most innocuous measures of oversight and accountability. CCTV cameras purchased to install in its head-office are still stored in the warehouses for six years, the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts (CoP) found recently.
