# Austerity, dispossession and injustice: Facets of the debt crisis in Sri Lanka

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Austerity-dispossession-and-injustice-Facets-of-the-debt-crisis-in-Sri-Lanka/4-761004)

The widespread and ongoing debt crisis today is a wakeup call

Sri Lanka defaulted on its external debt for the first time in its postcolonial history in April 2022.

The underlying analysis of the causes of the debt crisis itself is also flawed. Sri Lanka provides lessons about both the broken global financial system and the widespread consequences of an unjust debt resolution architecture affecting other countries in the Global South.
