# Why elections for Presidency all political parties have promised to abolish?

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Why-elections-for-Presidency-all-political-parties-have-promised-to-abolish/4-760144)

None in mainstream politics would lead this country on a right path to freedom, democracy and an inclusive society with socio-economic and cultural development. These political leaderships simply have no valid “development program” to back their criticism of the past and the present and their request for political power at the next “presidential” election. A larger crisis therefore is the timidity of the educated urban polity that has access to new information, new knowledge and new social discourses beyond geographical boundaries

*2024-04-01 01:56:25*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/What-is-wrong-with-Sri-Lanka/4-760143)

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70% responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30%. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.
