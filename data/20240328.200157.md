It is crucial to openly discuss with senior leaders how they are encouraging opportunities for women and individuals who are neurodivergent. We need to address diversity in all forms within our organisations. This involves implementing mechanisms to break down barriers and support career progression for everyone.

Developing digital public infrastructure – a critical measure to accelerate economic growth

Infrastructure development is a fundamental for economic growth. Any country seeking to improve its people’s lives must invest in infrastructure to ensure free and speedy movement of goods and services. Trade and commerce and therefore economic growth depend on such developments.

So historically the road to economic heaven has been literally that – building of roads, and other infrastructure for free and easy movement of goods. And this kind of development took years. Sometimes decades before its fruits could be tasted by the common man.

“A. K. Dissanayake increasingly has the demeanour of a national leader…”Prof. Mick Moore, OBE

‘Why Bharat Matters’, matters. The new book by one of the world’s most outstanding and admired foreign ministers, India’s Dr. S. Jaishankar, makes clear the centrality of Ramayana mythology within ‘Bharat’ as BJP’s India and BJP worldview. Cosmology dominates ideology.

In an ambitious exegetical enterprise, Dr. Jaishankar strives to confer the (non-secular) Ramayana a methodological and intellectual status as a strategic text that is implicitly above Kautilya’s (secular) Arthashasthra, a Realist classic. A tough sell, that.

It is not the country per se, but the politicians and the people who are wrong. While politicians should take 70 percent responsibility, the people also should take the rest or 30 percent. It is true that these wrongs on the part of the politicians or the people are not limited to Sri Lanka. Even in a country like Australia where I now live, there are intermittent corruption, crime, gender abuse, killing, and misguided politics. However, the difference is extremely vast. Sri Lanka’s wrongs are perhaps 50 times higher than a country like Australia.

The discourse to bring about education reforms has continued for decades. As a result, the government has drafted a National Education Policy Framework (NEPF) for a 10-year period from 2023-2033.

# Tropical Hydration Smoothie

Phew! The heat! Yes, that’s what everyone keeps saying these days. And the heat is awful, indeed.

With the heat situation hardly showing signs of improving, I thought of giving my readers something different this week.

Now place the pineapple chunks, mango chunks, banana, and coconut water in a blender. (If you are using spinach, add the handful of spinach as that would give an extra nutritional boost.)

Blend all ingredients, on high speed, until you achieve a smooth consistency. If the smoothie is too thick, you can add more coconut water to reach your desired thickness.
