A shadow of discord crept to form a year ago¬†between the United States and India, ignited by whispers of an assassination plot in New York. The accusations, though improbable, revealed underlying tensions between two purported allies.

Accused of orchestrating $250 million in bribes to secure energy contracts, Adani‚Äôs empire‚Äîonce touted as a cornerstone of India‚Äôs economic rise‚Äîfaced an unrelenting reckoning.

The landscape of Sinhala literature is vast in scope, rich in depth, and crowded with contributors. Many essays have been written about the authors of short stories, novels, and poems who have expanded their horizons and delved deeply into subjects that captured their interest.

When you see such work, then it is nearly impossible not to say something about that. The work of Kanchana Amilani is something that perfectly fits the bill.
