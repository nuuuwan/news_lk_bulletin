There are disagreements over the amount of land and housing that plantation workers need to live on, but this needs to be agreed upon. It is also believed that there won’t be enough land to operate the plantation industry if workers are given houses and land. We really want those who have this opinion to think about the following.

A shadow of discord crept to form a year ago between the United States and India, ignited by whispers of an assassination plot in New York. The accusations, though improbable, revealed underlying tensions between two purported allies. Not long after, Gautam Adani, a billionaire industrialist and confidant of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, found himself ensnared in controversy. Accused of orchestrating $250 million in bribes to secure energy contracts, Adani’s empire—once touted as a cornerstone of India’s economic rise—faced an unrelenting reckoning.

# Auroravia Inside Kanchana Amilani’s Head (And What’s Eating Her Up?)

[colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/auroravia-inside-kanchana-amilanis-head-and-whats-eating-her-up/)

The landscape of Sinhala literature is vast in scope, rich in depth, and crowded with contributors. Many essays have been written about the authors of short stories, novels, and poems who have expanded their horizons and delved deeply into subjects that captured their interest.

However, the written word that dares to explore vivid imaginations and push boundaries remains a rarity—though, paradoxically, it feels an oxymoron to suggest that imagination can ever have limits. When you see such work, then it is nearly impossible not to say something about that. The work of Kanchana Amilani is something that perfectly fits the bill.

Yenuli Neriah may not be a big name in the scene here but she did impress many on Sirisa TV’s The Voice Kids Blind Auditions singing ‘Master Sir.’

Yenuli is, in fact, based in Dubai and that is probably the reason local music lovers have not got the opportunity to experience her singing capabilities.

In Dubai, however, she is in the limelight but because of her schooling (she is only 14 years old) her work connected with the showbiz scene is limited.

Nevertheless, in order to keep herself in the spotlight, Yenuli has embarked on doing her own music and has come up with a vibrant track, called ‘Island Beat of Sri Lanka.’

Going forward, fostering inter-state developmental cooperation would remain a trying challenge for the global South. This is in view of the increasing complexities of international politics and economics. The hurdles to be cleared before such solidarity is established, even to a degree, are numerous.

Accordingly, the South would need to consider it compulsory to think and act on these questions cooperatively, to the extent possible, if the best interests of their peoples are to be served.
