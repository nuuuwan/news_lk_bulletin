The year was 2009. On 8 January, the army recaptured Palaly from the Tamil Tigers in efforts to reach the Jaffna Peninsula. I was a 10-year-old girl growing up in Colombo then and I was in year five.

I recall my teacher being in discomfort for the remainder of the class. At the time, I didn’t quite understand the impact his death had on Sri Lanka and what his assassination was going to mean for the future of dissent in the nation.

I shall not deal with the day to day work of the Non-Aligned Conference in plenary sessions and in committees and the substantive issues that were discussed and debated. I was not directly involved in these aspects, and there would be others more competent than I to write about such matters. My job was one of co-ordination, troubleshooting, and the prevention or resolution of any issue that could mar the proceedings of the conference.

I overcame the thought it was inauspicious to write about a death as Nan’s first column for the New Year. But it is a tribute to a great man and a life lived well and successfully, turning a huge country from economic depression to prosperity. Hence, presenting an inspiring human beacon to be followed to our country, now struggling to get out of economic difficulties with new leaders at the helm, is good. May there emerge statesmen from among them (of either gender) in the year 2025 and after.
