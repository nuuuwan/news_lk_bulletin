# Vietnam example: Communist factor in JVP-NPP mix could prove constructive

*2024-05-30 04:59:56*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Vietnam-example-Communist-factor-in-JVP-NPP-mix-could-prove-constructive/4-762354)

“First as tragedy, then as farce”. Marx’s legendary riff on Hegel springs to mind when forecasting the political future of Sarvajana Balaya, the rebranded bloc of Islamophobic ultranationalists from the Zombieland of the Gotabaya Presidency and old Leftists.

I expect it to be extinguished through Sarvajana Chanda Balaya (universal franchise) at the forthcoming Parliamentary election just as the SLFP’s allies were in 1977. Its rancid ultranationalism is anathema to the youth of the Aragalaya generation and while its old personalities and discourse will give ex-MR voters someone to punish, for the painful Gotabaya fiasco.
