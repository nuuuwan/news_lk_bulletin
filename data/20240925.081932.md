# Restraint on economy and full-steam on governance ‚Äì AKD‚Äôs implicit strategy?

*2024-09-25 04:45:20*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Restraint-on-economy-and-full-steam-on-governance-AKD-s-implicit-strategy/4-767104)

What will be the strategy of the new President who soon will be going into a Parliamentary election? My reading is that the implicit strategy of AKD is to practice restraint on economic issues and go full steam on governance. This is evident from the way the campaign progressed with convergence on the economic front between candidates, but with AKD managing to rise above others with his convincing battle cry to restore trust in politicians and politics.

If that indeed is the strategy, it will be a win-win for all concerned.

The collapse of the Soviet Union, China‚Äôs adoption of market driven policy, North Korea‚Äôs boorish behaviour and the history of brutal, totalitarian regimes that claimed to be ‚ÄúMarxist‚Äù have contributed to the erroneous notion that Karl Marx was an authoritarian thinker.

Some of my granddaughters have asked me who this Karl Marx was. I told them that Karl Marx was an Enlightenment age humanist and a philosopher who perceived the possibility of a utopian post capitalist society in which people could lead rich, fulfilling lives.
