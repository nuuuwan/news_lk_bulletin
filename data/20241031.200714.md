Let the world be the light of ignorance and the light of wisdom. உலகெங்கிலும் உள்ள இந்து மக்களின் இதயங்களை ஒளிமயமாக்கும் தீபாவளி திருநாளை முன்னிட்டு, இலங்கை மற்றும் உலகெங்கிலும் வாழும் இந்து மக்களுக்கு வாழ்த்துக்களைத் தெரிவிப்பதில் மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சி அடைகிறேன் என்று ஐக்கிய மக்கள் சக்தித் தலைவர்  சஜித் பிரேமதாச  விடுத்துள்ள தீபாவளி வாழ்த்துச் செய்தியில் தெரிவித்துள்ளார்.

Great darkness can be removed by a small light. All that is needed is only a proper view and guidance. அறியாமை இருளை அகற்றி ஞானத்தின் ஒளியால் உலகை ஒளிமயமாக்கும் தீபாவளி பண்டிகை நமக்கு உணர்த்துவதும் இதுவேதான்.

In his Diwali greeting, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that we have initiated the era of change of public expectations.

The Diwali festival is celebrated by Hindu devotees in the world to mark the light of darkness.

The Sri Lankan people who have been searching for light from the dark after independence are now carrying new expectations. This is the many years expectation of the people. We have begun the age of change of the expectations of the public who have been paralyzed by the rulers of Sri Lanka for so many days.

On the campaign trail, President AKD followed-up his memorable line “I hear talk in certain places about an Opposition. An Opposition? No. What we need now is a powerful Government!” with a no less memorable and ominous one: “They think this government will be short-lived but I’m telling you this Government will step down only after having rebuilt the entire country!”

He should have said “this government will step down only if you decide it should at a national election”.
