It is an old truism in policy analysis that there is nothing purely ‘technical’ in policy decisions. Every policy decision has a political aspect to it. Technical analysis is necessary and useful to identify and evaluate feasible options, including the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, what is selected or rejected is a political matter based on political preferences. There is nothing wrong with that. What gets to be objectionable is when decisions are made to reach outcomes to benefit some or deny someone else based on inappropriate considerations.

Unlike Vesak, Poson is specific to Sri Lanka and India. It celebrates the coming of Buddhism to the island through an embassy of five monks, one samanera, and one layman, led by Mahinda Thera, the son of Asoka from his second wife, Vedisa-Devi. The Dipavamsa and the  Mahavamsa are the main literary sources from this country that we have for the details of this embassy. All other accounts are variations on them.

# Unbundling The CEB II: Ranil & The Politics Of Reforming SOEs

[colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/unbundling-the-ceb-ii-ranil-the-politics-of-reforming-soes/)

It is an old truism in policy analysis that there is nothing purely ‘technical’ in policy decisions. Every policy decision has a political aspect to it. Technical analysis is necessary and useful to identify and evaluate feasible options, including the costs and benefits of each option. In the end, what is selected or rejected is a political matter based on political preferences. There is nothing wrong with that. What gets to be objectionable is when decisions are made to reach outcomes to benefit some or disbenefit someone else based on inappropriate considerations.
