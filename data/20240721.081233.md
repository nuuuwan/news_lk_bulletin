To quote. “Religion should be the motor of life, the central heating plant of personality, the faith that gives joy to activity, hope to struggle, dignity to humility and zest to living.” Upliftment is the keynote. Yet Religion has been the cause of the most appalling bloodshed and strife . The most horrendous wars have been fought in the name of religion and rivers of blood have flowed while idiots quarreled over the words of god-like men who must have been appalled by the distortion of their messages to humanity. So let us agree that religion DIVIDES and most certainly does not UNITE.
