The major argument of this article is to discuss whether Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s political path is suitable for the socio-political recovery in Sri Lanka. Apparently, he seems to be a possible candidate for the forthcoming presidential election because of his long-term political experiences as a member of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. But is it enough to be a leader of this fallen land? This land is at present going through different crises. It is in chaos. There is no point in becoming a microphone-political-leader who addresses people with heavy arguments. That is an outdated tradition, which has no sense at all.
