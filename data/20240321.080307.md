# Books & Elections: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s Claim Of Foreign Conspiracy

[colombotelegraphcom](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/books-elections-president-gotabaya-rajapaksas-claim-of-foreign-conspiracy/)

Gotabaya Rajapaksa has well explained his own tragedy where the protagonist comprehends his insignificance. To comprehend a self-diagnosis with an insignificance is neither an act of cowardice but the opposite; this value of Gotabaya’s self-diagnosis must be appreciated.

Bombs directly impact election results in South Asia, as discussed in my book ‘Conundrum of an Island’. The last major bomb attack in Sri Lanka, the Easter Sunday Terror attack, certainly altered the voter path towards restoring National Security upon the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019.
