*2024-06-08 00:50:00*

[virakesarilk](https://www.virakesari.lk/article/185575)

Canada won Ireland by 12 runs in the R20 World Cup for A Group, which ended shortly before the New York Nasav Kanderi International Cricket Stadium.

This is the first win in Canada's debut in this year's World Cup.

Ireland's 16th over was not interesting in the match as the two teams scored the run.

However, when Mark Adyar and George Dogrell began to hit the 17th over in the match, there was some excitement in the match. They were unable to prevent Canada's victory as the two of them were delayed.

In response, Ireland lost 7 wickets in 20 overs and lost 125 runs.

Ireland scored 53 runs for the loss of 5 wickets in the 11th over.
