“The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving servants of tyranny a good conscience “

History will remember President Ranil Wickremesinghe elected by a secret vote in Parliament to serve the remainder of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidential term for another curiously distinctive reason. He will be remembered for the number of policy statements and ceremonial openings of Parliament during his tenure.

Moral high ground is not a podium to preach from. It is an arduous mountain; one climbs on one’s own.
