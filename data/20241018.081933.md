# Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad

[adaderanalk](https://www.adaderana.lk/news/102755/italy-makes-it-illegal-to-seek-surrogacy-abroad)

Italy‚Äôs parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Minister‚Äôs Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.

Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.

The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Meloni‚Äôs Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.
