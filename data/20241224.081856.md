Many Sri Lankans may inquire why we should borrow from bondholders again and if this is detrimental. Allow me to explain as simply as possible. It would be ideal if we never had to borrow from international capital markets. However, Sri Lanka does not have a choice at present.

With an inactive, inefficient public sector, can a government run a country and lead it to the utopia that we all think of? Let’s dive into this more deeply and see the depth of the problem.
