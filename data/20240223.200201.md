Those who are in possession of drugs. But has it ever occurred to these knights in shining armour, who go after those who possess drugs, that there is another group on whom no drugs are found or will ever be found, who are nevertheless, the masterminds of the drug trade?

Those elections would see a direct clash between a generation of geriatric leaders who grew in and groomed by a society stratified by castes, ethnicity, religions, and so on, and a younger, talented and globally connected generation to which the society of their elders has become alien.

Buddhism is a teaching expounded by the Buddha, who lived in northern India between the mid-6th century and mid-4th century BCE. However, there is a disagreement among some scholars as to the exact dates of his birth and death. It is believed that Buddhism has an estimated 500 million followers worldwide today. Many civilisations and countless lives have been shaped by the Buddha’s thinking enunciated in his discourses. What the Buddha expounded for nearly half a century is known as dhamma which is just as pertinent in the contemporary world as it was several centuries ago. In brief, dhamma means reality.
