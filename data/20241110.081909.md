On many occasions, one had to absorb a significant degree of shock and act as a facilitator, mediator or referee. A rousing example of this side of one’s responsibilities came by courtesy of Mrs. Vivienne Goonewardene, the LSSP Member of Parliament for Dehiwela-Galkissa and wife of Mr. Leslie Goonewardene, Minister of Communications.

[islandlk](http://island.lk/chandra-arulpragasam-the-enigma-that-was-my-father/)

When my son was 11 years old and in middle school, he chose to write about his grandfather, starting his essay with the statement, “my grandfather is an enigma.” I am not sure whether to his young mind my father was so much a puzzle, being both a super -cool grandpa and an exacting teacher, or just simply unpredictable. My father was someone who could relate to his grandchildren only when they were old enough to debate the merits of the separation of state and church or play a championship game of chess. But he also had wonderful adventures which fired my son’s young imagination.
