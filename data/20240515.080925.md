# Lankan mercenaries fighting in Russo-Ukraine war - EDITORIAL

*2024-05-15 00:02:00*

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Lankan-mercenaries-fighting-in-Russo-Ukraine-war-EDITORIAL/172-282591)

Media reports have been circulating of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel being involved in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. With the war raging in Ukraine, many Ukrainian males of military age have fled to neighbouring EU countries to avoid military service. It should not be unexpected that recruiters would seek battle-hardened military men from foreign lands.

[dailymirrorlk](https://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/Last-throes-of-dynastic-enterprise-Rajapaksa-plots-to-stall-recovery-after-ruining-economy/172-282590)

Mahinda Rajapaksa thrives in a sense of inviolability and a culture of  impunity fostered by the very system that sustains their political  existence.

Like the rest of his ilk in this part of the world, Mahinda Rajapaksa overstayed his welcome in the power. He ran the economy to the ground as he did with the national carrier, which he re-nationalized out of a fit of rage after its Emirates management refused to deplane fee-levying passengers to make room for his entourage.

He tried on a dynastic power grab that went spectacularly wrong, ending in the worst-ever financial crisis since the independence.

I write these words with a sense of urgency and anticipation, believing that the time has come to reflect and adapt. The seeds you sow knowingly or unknowingly have reaped a bitter harvest of division and discontent among the people of our Nation. Your brand of politics has had a lasting impact on our society, characterized by its bitterness and divisiveness. From the turbulent events of 71 to the unrest of 88 and 89, the scars of past conflicts continue to haunt us. The stagnant narrative of 76 years of curse and rejection of 225 has perpetuated, casting a shadow over our collective aspirations.
