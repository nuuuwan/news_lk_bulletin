I refer to the front page headlined news report in the Daily News paper of 29th February 2024 and wish to express my independent, objective views as a free thinker.

Indian Ocean as the name suggest is virtually India’s Ocean, because India is the predominant country in the region. The security of the Indian Ocean is a major concern of India, as much as those of the other littoral countries, including Sri Lanka. In this light, saying that Sri Lanka will remain neutral is preposterous. Sri Lanka’s security is also tied up with the Indian Ocean Security. Therefore, it cannot remain neutral and do nothing about it.
