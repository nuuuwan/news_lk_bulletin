Robert Frost once wrote, ‘Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.’ It’s a place like Hotel California in the popular Eagles song by that name — you can check out any time you like but you can never leave.

It’s all about family. The prodigal son or daughter can return. And when they do, other residents cannot pack their bags and leave, however distasteful the returnee has turned out to be or the returning is.

# Popes and Cardinals

The enthusiasm generated by the election of a new Pope may give the impression that the 500 million Roman Catholics – sometimes derisively called Papists – are a separate species of human beings. That is not the impression I carried away, after a stay of over five years in Rome. Roman Catholics are, I am certain, like the rest of us, capable of all the follies to which human frailty exposes men and women.

The Pope does not dictate the policies of governments; not even those of the Government of Italy which, in recent times has been successively totalitarian, conservative, middle-of – the-road, and left of center.
