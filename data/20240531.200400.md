Ambassadorial aspirants hardly break a sweat when drafting submissions to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, not even in pre-ChatGPT days. They’ve been in the business of US diplomacy long enough to know what ‘US Foreign Policy’ is. They know what the listers want to hear. They have templates to choose from. And therefore the opening statement made on May 9, 2024 to the Committee by Elizabeth K Horst, nominee to be the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, is more or less par for the course. A parenthesis is called for here.

Whichever way Sri Lanka chooses to go, will ultimately be determined by its core values

Sri Lanka, since independence has been on a road that was not quite destined to reach a destination. Then, after almost 30 years of independence, with light to moderate progress, the economy underwent a radical change in 1977. We were told that this would make Sri Lanka a developed country in a short time span.

Things did not work out as expected and the next four and a half decades brought us to bankruptcy. There is not much purpose in blaming others, when we ourselves were to blame.
