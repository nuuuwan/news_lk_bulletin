The Colombo High Court rejected the bail application filed by the counsels representing the recently imprisoned Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday.

# The creations of Mary Shelley and that of Lord Balfour – are there lessons to be learnt?

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-creations-of-Mary-Shelley-and-that-of-Lord-Balfour-are-there-lessons-to-be-learnt/4-760231)

The creations of Mary Shelley and Lord Balfour; the former being fiction and the latter being played out in 4K ultra-HD resolution today, are separated by time and space, but offer lessons for the enquiring mind.

The vote taken on 29th November 1947 to create the state of Israel, was rejected by all Arab States. On 30th November, the very next day, the first phase of the Arab-Israeli war began and ended with thousands dead and the forcible expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.

World leaders refused to accept the ominous beginning as a harbinger of darker, more dangerous times ahead.

# When “Aiyo” Sirisena accused India’s RAW of plotting to assassinate him

There is a salient point that needs to be emphasised. If the media reports about Sirisena’s accusations against India are correct, then I must assert strongly that I do not believe ex-president Sirisena at all. I am no fan of the RAW or any other intelligence agency but linking the RAW to the Easter bombings is highly improbable and totally absurd

The National People’s Power’s (NPP) current election campaign aiming for the presidential election has a strong momentum. The confident body language of its leadership is one indicator of this. Their rallies are well-attended and there appears to be a strong bottom-up support. The NPP’s seemingly growing electoral prospects have propelled it to being in the centre of political discourse, and this has led other political parties/factions to be on the defensive.
