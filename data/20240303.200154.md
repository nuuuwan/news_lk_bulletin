The worst crisis Sri Lanka faced was in 2022, when it had to declare bankruptcy. A 30-year civil war, two insurrections, racial riots and a tsunami had not deterred this nation from repaying its loans on time. But one corrupt family and their cohorts had brought our country to its knees. Overnight, an incompetent president lost control, and the country was plunged into economic and social chaos.

Transport was at a virtual standstill due to a shortage of fuel; people died standing in queues for gas; schools had closed; 10- to 13-hour power cuts were the order of the day; and children were dying due to a lack of basic medicines.

We cannot blame anyone but the Government for this given its postponement of elections including local government elections arguing that it did not have the required funds, unashamedly citing the country’s bankruptcy propelled by a crass and corrupt ruling class.
