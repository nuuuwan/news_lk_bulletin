# Increasing tax revenue without hiking tax burden

*2024-12-15 23:38:25*

[dailyftlk](https://www.ft.lk/columns/Increasing-tax-revenue-without-hiking-tax-burden/4-770535)

No one willingly parts what they own, unless the return is of equal or greater value, regardless of its tangibility – and this applies to taxes as well. The million-dollar question for Sri Lankan taxpayers is: what do we really get in return for the taxes we pay?

Despite the Government’s efforts to promote taxation as a civic duty, flawed tax policies are undermining public trust. The fundamental principle of taxation is fairness, which means taxation should be based on ability to pay.
