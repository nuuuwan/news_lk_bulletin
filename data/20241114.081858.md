Let the tea bags cool slowly at room temperature or chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Your cold brew might give you a refreshing jolt, but a caffeine fix for the skin can also help calm blotchiness or swelling.

Start by freezing some brewed coffee in an ice cube tray. Once the coffee ice is ready, spend a few minutes gently rubbing an ice cube: under your eyes, along your brows, across the bridge of your nose, and from the outer corners of your eyes to your temples

The multidimensional triumph of Donald Trump is an outcome I hardly applaud, but as a political scientist and former diplomat, I cannot fail to note its magnitude, even epic character, and respect the political achievement.
